# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
// We built a webpage that allows users to view different motivational posters. It also allows users to create their own poster with an image, motivational quote, and title they select. Users may also choose to save the poster they created or save a randomly generated poster. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
They need to visit our github, choose to fork the repository, and then clone it down to their local machine. The steps to clone are to copy the SSH link in the github fork under the code button, and then navigate to their terminal and enter git clone "SSH link". After that, they need to navigate to the directory on their machine where the files are stored. When the files are located the user can run code., to open the files in their text editor. From there they can run open index.html to view the app in their browser, and use the apps features. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

The coolest part is the ability for a user to create their own motivational poster.
### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We had 6 days to complete the project. We are 2 weeks into the program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Write clean, DRY JavaScript, begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and to build an understanding of writing code collaboratively. We worked with vs code, chrome dev tools, and lots of google.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
A couple wins that stood out were when we figured out how to utilize the closest method to delete an image, and when we figured out how to take an image from the web and input it into our create a poster field. 
We faced many challenges during this project, most notably getting a double click to delete an image. It took us roughly 6 hours of research and coding to finally come up with the closest mehtod.
